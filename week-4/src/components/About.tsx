                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I strive to develop myself in various fields and possess a wide range of skills in programming
                        and design. Currently, I am proficient in the following programming languages: Python, C++, C#,
                        Java, and C.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy working on diverse projects, especially if they are interesting and unique. I don't stick
                        to specific technologies but learn new languages, skills, and technologies as needed. I take
                        pleasure in being useful and implementing interesting projects.</p>
